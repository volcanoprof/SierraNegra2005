Our numerical approach utilizes previously developed and benchmarked, thermomechanical and fluid-structure interaction FEM models (Grosfils, 2007; Gregg et al., 2012; Gregg et al., 2013; Hickey and Gottsmann, 2014; Le Mével et al., 2016). COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 is used to calculate the stress, strain, and temperature variations due to a viscous magma injected from a deeper source into an existing, magma-filled reservoir. A symmetry boundary is assumed on the left of the model, a free surface is assumed at the top of the model space, roller boundary conditions are applied on the right side and base of the model and an inlet boundary is assumed at the base of the conduit. Model parameters and variables are provided in the GRL Supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively.

The included COMSOL models utilize the following additional modules: Heat Transfer Module, LiveLink for MATLAB, Nonlinear Structural Materials Module, Structure Mechanics Module, and Subsurface Flow Module.
